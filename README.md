Use these placeholders in your email templates:

- `{{Name}}` - Target's name
- `{{Email}}` - Target's email
- `{{Department}}` - Target's department
- `{{Role}}` - Target's role
- `{{Location}}` - Target's location
- `{{Link}}` - Tracking link (REQUIRED for click tracking)

Example template:
```html
<p>Hello {{Name}},</p>
<p>Your {{Department}} team needs to verify your account.</p>
<p><a href="{{Link}}">Click here to verify</a></p>
<p>IT Department</p>
```

### Importing Targets

```bash
POST /api/campaigns
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "Q4 Security Test",
  "email_subject": "Action Required: {{Name}}",
  "email_body": "<html>...</html>",
  "from_address": "security@company.com"
}
```

**Get Campaign Details:**
```bash
GET /api/campaigns/{id}
```

## Development

### Backend Development

```bash
cd backend

# Install dependencies
go mod download

# Run migrations
# (Auto-runs on startup, or manually:)
# psql -U phish -d phishsim -f migrations/001_init.sql

# Run server
go run cmd/server/main.go
```

### Frontend Development

```bash
cd frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run dev server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build
npm start
```

### Database Access

```bash
# Connect to PostgreSQL
docker-compose exec db psql -U phish -d phishsim

# View tables
\dt

# View campaigns
SELECT * FROM campaigns;

# View targets
SELECT * FROM targets LIMIT 10;

# View events
SELECT * FROM events ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 20;
```

## Production Deployment

### 1. Update Environment Variables

- Change `JWT_SECRET` to a strong random string (32+ characters)
- Change all default passwords
- Update `APP_HOST` to your domain
- Use production SMTP credentials

### 2. Build and Deploy

```bash
# Build production images
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml build

# Start services
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```

### 3. SSL/TLS Setup

Use a reverse proxy (Nginx/Caddy) with Let's Encrypt:

```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name phishsim.yourdomain.com;
    
    ssl_certificate /path/to/cert.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /path/to/key.pem;
    
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
    }
    
    location /api {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:8080;
    }
}
```

### 4. Security Hardening

- Enable firewall rules (only allow 80/443)
- Regular security updates
- Database backups
- Monitor logs for suspicious activity
- Rate limiting on API endpoints

## Testing Locally

### Test with Your Own Email

1. Create campaign with your email as target
2. Send campaign
3. Check your email inbox
4. Click tracking link
5. Submit fake credentials on landing page
6. View results in dashboard

### Sample Test Flow

```bash
# 1. Login
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"admin","password":"Admin123!"}' \
  -c cookies.txt

# 2. Create campaign
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/campaigns \
  -b cookies.txt \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Test Campaign",
    "email_subject": "Test",
    "email_body": "<p>Hello {{Name}}, <a href=\"{{Link}}\">click here</a></p>",
    "from_address": "test@example.com"
  }'

# 3. Upload targets CSV
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/campaigns/{id}/upload-targets \
  -b cookies.txt \
  -F "file=@samples/targets_sample.csv"

# 4. Send campaign
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/campaigns/{id}/send \
  -b cookies.txt
```

## Troubleshooting

### Emails Not Sending

1. Check SMTP credentials in `.env`
2. Verify SMTP port is not blocked by firewall
3. Check logs: `docker-compose logs app`
4. Test SMTP connection:
   ```bash
   telnet smtp.gmail.com 587
   ```

### Database Connection Issues

```bash
# Check if database is running
docker-compose ps

# View database logs
docker-compose logs db

# Reset database
docker-compose down -v
docker-compose up -d
```

### Frontend Not Connecting to Backend

1. Verify `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` in frontend `.env.local`
2. Check CORS settings in backend
3. Verify both services are running

### JWT Token Issues

1. Ensure `JWT_SECRET` is set and consistent
2. Clear browser cookies
3. Check token expiration time
